        <center><p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px"> Madalena has over four years of tutoring experience, initially balancing her work with her studies and now dedicating herself to tutoring full-time following a year spent studying Algebraic Geometry at the University of Cambridge.
She holds a First Class Honours BSc in Mathematics from King's College London, having previously achieved nine grade 9s and one A* at GCSE, alongside A* grades in both Mathematics and Further Mathematics at A-Level. Her strong academic foundation underpins the depth and rigour she brings to every lesson.
Now tutoring full-time, Madalena is committed to helping driven students reach their full potential in mathematics. She adopts a highly individualised approach, carefully adapting to each student’s goals and learning style. Known for her patience and clarity, she has a particular talent for breaking down complex ideas into intuitive, accessible concepts.
Her aim is not only for her students to achieve top grades, but to become confident and capable problem-solvers who can approach unfamiliar questions with clarity and composure. She focuses on building genuine mathematical understanding, enabling her students to face challenges independently and achieve their academic goals.</p></center>
