                    <p>When a student first contacts me, I arrange a trial lesson and ask a few key questions beforehand. I’ll ask which topics they would like to focus on, what year group they are in, and their current level of confidence in maths. This allows me to prepare a targeted and productive first session. During lessons, we work through carefully selected questions and concepts step by step. I encourage students to explain their thinking so I can understand their reasoning and address any misconceptions immediately. My focus is on building strong foundations, developing exam technique where relevant, and strengthening problem-solving skills. After the trial, we establish a consistent weekly schedule and I create a structured plan tailored to the student’s goals.</p>

                <div class="mySlides">
                    <p>With regular sessions, students can expect clearer understanding of complex topics, improved confidence when tackling unfamiliar problems, stronger logical reasoning and structured working, better exam performance through refined technique and practice. I keep track of progress over time and provide feedback so both students and parents can clearly see improvement.</p>

                <div class="mySlides">
                    <p>Lessons usually take place on Microsoft Teams. I use my iPad to present practice questions and explanations. With certain students, I use Miro as a shared whiteboard, where both of us can write in real time. This setup allows us to work interactively and ensures I can see exactly how a student is thinking. Furthermore, it facilitates instant feedback and error correcting.</p>
