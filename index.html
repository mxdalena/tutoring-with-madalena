        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am mainly interested in guiding growing brilliant minds to a level of confidence that allows them to face any problem with a clear mind and a range of mathematical tools. I have my own students, who I teach one-to-one and I also work for two agencies: Parallel Academy and Tutorberry. At Parallel I tutor small classes of gifted students to prepare for Maths Challenges and at Tutorberry I am part of a growing team of female maths tutors. </p>
