            <p>I am a full-time mathematics tutor working with students at a variety of levels: primary, GCSE, A-Level and university. I graduated from King's College London with a First Class Honours in BSc Mathematics.</p>

            <center><h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p> My passion is to guide brilliant minds to reach a level of confidence that allows them to face any problem with a clear mind and a range of mathematical tools. I have my own students, who I teach one-to-one, and I also work for two agencies: Parallel Academy and Tutorberry. At Parallel I tutor small classes of gifted students to prepare them for Maths Challenges and at Tutorberry I am part of a growing team of female maths tutors.</p>
